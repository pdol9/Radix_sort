# sorting_algorithm

implementation of radix sort to sort positive and negative numbers in ascending order with the least instructions (moves) possible, specifically for set of 100 and 500 numbers, with following limitations:
- using only 2 stacks
- allowed operations when sorting (moving a number from top of the stack to the bottom and vice-versa, switching top 2 numbers at the top of the stack, moving bottom number to the top of the 2nd stack)
- no global variables
